As time passes, the winter in the Northern Hemisphere is drawing to a close, and signs of spring are reviving everywhere.
Gazing at the snowy scenery of Mira, are the memories within awakened? The warmth still flows in the heart.
No matter who the suspicion ultimately falls on, no matter whose hands the truth finally shatters in,
In the refreshed experience, brainstorming, leaving behind brand-new happy memories.
Having fun is the most important!!!
