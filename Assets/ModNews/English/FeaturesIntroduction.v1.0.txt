## Warning!
- If you see a cheater, it means they have engaged in illegal behavior or are on the mod ban list, but it does not necessarily mean their actions are cheating or that they are currently cheating.
For example: When you see (Invalid RPC: 150), it means the other party may be a 「Better Among Us」 player, but we do not support their RPC and we will regard players who send invalid RPCs as cheaters.
Of course, you can rest assured that because of our unique mutual recognition method, you will not be judged as a cheater in their view!
- When a mod bug occurs, please click on 「Client Features - Log Output」 to output the log and feedback it along with the bug!
- Except for 「Simplified Chinese」 and 「English」, all other languages are translated by AI and may have deviations, please feedback in time!
